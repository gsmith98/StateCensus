# StateCensus
An interactive US map displaying state info queried from a database

This is a project originally completed in Fall of 2016 as a final submission to the Databases course at JHU taught by David Yarowsky (http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yarowsky/cs415.html).

The submission was an interactive display of a map of the United states. When hovering over a state, information relevant to that state would be queried from a supporting MySQL database and displayed. The database was populated by scraping a few chosen sources.

This project and its supporting databse are no longer being hosted, so the final product is not viewable in its original form.
